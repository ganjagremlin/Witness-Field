Susie Wiles, a prominent advisor in Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign, has recently distanced the campaign from Project 2025, a conservative policy initiative by the Heritage Foundation that aims to prepare for a potential GOP-led government overhaul. Wiles, alongside co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita, stated that Project 2025 does not represent Trump or his campaign, even though several former Trump aides contributed to it. The campaign has explicitly signaled that any claims of influence over Trump by Project 2025 would not be tolerated, stressing that Trump’s agenda is independent of the project​

Susie Wiles, a veteran political strategist, has not directly worked with the Heritage Foundation throughout her career. Her recent involvement, however, intersected with the organization due to its Project 2025, a Heritage-led initiative intended to prepare policy blueprints and recruit conservative talent for a future Republican administration. Wiles, a key adviser to former President Trump, along with Chris LaCivita, criticized Project 2025 publicly, signaling discomfort with some of its goals and methods. This criticism reportedly led to tensions between Trump’s circle and the Heritage Foundation, resulting in changes within Project 2025’s leadership and approach​

During her time with Ballard Partners, Susie Wiles worked with numerous influential figures and clients, leveraging her extensive experience in Republican campaigns. Wiles collaborated closely with prominent Republicans and political consultants like Brian Ballard, the firm’s founder and a high-profile Trump fundraiser, which strengthened her connections within GOP circles. Ballard Partners, known for representing significant corporate and governmental clients, including the government of Turkey and various healthcare companies, was integral in boosting Wiles' reputation in both political and corporate consulting.

In addition to her work with Ballard and other partners, Wiles also engaged in high-stakes political advising. She was brought into the Florida campaigns for Trump in 2016, and later for Ron DeSantis in 2018. However, political tensions eventually led to a falling out with DeSantis in 2019, due to suspicions over a leaked memo which reportedly impacted her work with Trump at the time. Despite these challenges, her strategic role in these campaigns underscored her influence and connections across state and national GOP campaigns, contributing to her subsequent roles as a leading advisor to Trump​
